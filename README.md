I have two very simple web scrapers in this folder. 

The main.py file gets quotes and puts them into a text file. Since I am an author, that's helpful, because I do sometimes need a quote.

The second one, blog_scraper.py, scrapes one author's tech blog. I didn't get complicated here because I wanted a file that can be reused for numerous blogs.

I was very careful to only scrape sites that allow it. The window gets narrower over time as more sites are checking for human interaction.

This was for my 100DaysofCode class.
